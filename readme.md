[Newsdata.io API](https://newsdata.io/)

Please follow setup instructions below.

Authentication is done via the Newsdata.io Dashboard. You will receive an API key that you'd have to pass to the request.
See the newsdata.io documentation in [Documentation](https://newsdata.io/documentation).

Create a Newsdata.io account. Go to newsdata.io dashboard API Key tab and use that API key to send requests.

Go to documentation and test out any endpoint. You can choose Code Snippet for almost any programming language or terminal. Your unique API key will be already pasted in.

For bonus tasks review the Header Parameters and Optional Parameters sections for each endpoint. Be aware there is a request per day limit.
